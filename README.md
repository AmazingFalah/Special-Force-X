Hello everyone, My name is Muhammad Nur Falah. And today, my group want to share our project about Database management system using Python and MySQL

And if you want to play with our code, you will need to follow our step-by-step instruction:

1. Copy and Paste SFX.txt and put it in your prefered SQL Query (PHPmyadmin, MySQL Workbench, etc)
2. Download moduls inside your Python prefered application. The modul are (pip install mysql-connector-python) and (pip install bcrypt)
3. After downloading the moduls, you can start playing with the "GameManageDemo.py". Remember to always check the connection between your Python and your MySQL, because if the connection is severed, then the program will be resulted in a error
